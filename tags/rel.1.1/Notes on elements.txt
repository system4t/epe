Input type=radio
----------------
The only way to create a radio button and giving it a name is by
document.createElement('<input name=value>')
EPE will give an element created with such a declaration a type of HTMLElement. This is not
all that bad as the element will stilll have the prototype declarations of HTMLInputElement.
